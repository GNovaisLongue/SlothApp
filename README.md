Final Project - Mobile App
Done using React

This project is yet to be finished. It's on hold given some necessities to gather more knowledge about React and hybrid development.
Initialy developed for mobile usage, but, given some unexpected issues, was hosted and presented via browser hosted on https://slothapp.netlify.app (heroku updated their terms, breaking my back end).
